          <p>Service-based applications have the ability to change their constituent services at runtime. This implies that they have the ability to change both, their functionality and their QoS attributes dynamically. 
             We present a Cloud-based-Multi-Agent System (Clobmas) that uses multiple double auctions, to enable applications to self-adapt, based on their QoS requirements and budgetary constraints. 
             QoS attributes needed to provided, maintained, monitored at run time. A double auction is a two-sided auction, i.e., both the buyers and the sellers indicate the price that theyâ€™re willing to pay and accept, respectively. 
             If any application uses self adaptation mechanism then it exhibit a high QoS. Here we design a marketplace that allows applications to select services, in a decentralized manner. 
             In this, we use a continuous double-auction(CDA) to allow applications to decide which services to choose, amongst the many on offer. Clobmas is shown to be an effective mechanism, to allow both applications (service consumers) and clouds (service providers) to self-adapt to dynamically changing QoS requirements. 
             Clobmas satisfies the  functional properties and scalability goals.</p><br><br>
